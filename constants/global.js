      "Wealthy South Americans looking to move to the United States are finding the EB-5 immigrant investor visa a very appealing option. In 2023, the US government granted EB-5 visas and adjustment-of-statuses to nearly 400 South American investors, a number dominated by Brazilians and Venezuelans. Marcelo Gorenstein, Brazil director for Dhanani EB-5, said that investor visas to Portugal and Spain are also popular among South Americans. Investors in EB-5 visas tend toward planning a new life in the United States and gaining the career and educational advantages that green cards offer their families. The EB-5 also allows investors from South American countries with volatile currencies to safeguard their wealth. In contrast, South American investors in Portuguese and Spanish visas are often more interested in establishing a home in Europe just in case they need to relocate quickly due to social and economic instability in their home countries. The benefits differ between the two countries; Portugal allows holders of the Portugal Golden Visa to reside in Portugal for as few as seven days a year, whereas Spain offers special status to investors from former Spanish colonies, allowing them to apply for citizenship after only two years of residence in Spain, unlike immigrants from non-colony countries, who must reside there for 10 years before applying.",
