    answer: `<div><p>The EB-5 visa is an immigrant visa available in the United States which enables foreign investors to obtain permanent residency in the United States.
In order to obtain an EB-5 visa, the foreign investor must make a qualifying investment in a new commercial enterprise that creates jobs in the country.</p><br /><ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
  <li class="list-group-item">To qualify for an EB-5 visa (a green card), an investor needs to make a minimum investment of $1,050,000 in a new commercial enterprise. If the investment is made in a targeted employment area (TEA) however, this minimum investment amount is reduced to $800,000.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Because the EB5 Visa program aims to create jobs for U.S. workers and fuel economic growth in the country, a part of the investment must create or preserve at least 10-full time jobs for U.S. workers. This needs to be achieved within two years of receiving a conditional green card. The majority of EB-5 investments are made through designated regional centers. These are private entities that facilitate the investment process and help investors meet the job creation requirement.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">  Initially, the foreign investor will be granted a conditional green card, which is valid for two years upon approval of the EB-5 petition.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"> After the two year period, the investor will need to file a petition to remove the conditions on their green card and prove that the investment and job creation requirements have been met.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"> Once these conditions have been removed, the investor and his or her family will receive permanent resident status and qualify for permanent green cards in the U.S.</li>

    <p>Asset-based loans are the most common capital source. Loans are acceptable sources of funds, but investors must provide evidence that all assets and loans were obtained legally.</p>
    <p class="fw-bold">Can you apply for an EB5- while holding an H-1B visa?</p>

Thus, you can take part in the EB-5 program while you are working in the United States without canceling your H-1B visa or any pending green card petition. All you need to do is maintain your H-1B status until the EB5 petitions you have filed with USCIS have been approved: first, I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Investor, and, subsequently, I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.</p>

    <p>The EB-5 visa process is one of the fastest and reliable ways for immigrant investors and their family to receive permanent residence status in the U.S. The EB5 process takes several years to complete.Total time required varies depending on factors such as:</p>

            <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
              <li class="list-group-item">If the USCIS believes not enough evidence exists to justify approval of a petition, it may issue a request for evidence (RFE) to collect further information. There is also the chance that the USCIS may issue a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID), which signifies that the adjudicator believes the petition should be denied but wishes to present the investor the opportunity to clear up any areas of concern. Both of these notices may delay an investor’s petition and involve additional costs to revise the petition materials, for example, to consult with counsel.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">An investor has the option of requesting an administrative review if his or her petition is denied, but this involves a significant waiting period. Luckily, the approximate approval rates for I-526 and 1-829 petitions are 85% and 90%, respectively.</li>

However, such cases are relatively rare.</li>

    question: "What Are The Processing Procedures For The EB-5 Program?",
    answer: `<div>
    <p>A potential investor is required to file a form I-526 for Alien Entrepreneur in conjunction with the documents supporting the business in which the investment is being made, which satisfy the EB-5 Investor Visa program requirements. Upon approval of this application, the investor and immediate family (spouse and single children under 21 years of age) may apply for an Immigrant Visa at the US Consulate, or if the investor is already located in the United States, apply for adjustment of status at any regional USCIS office. The entire application process may take nine to fifteen months to be fully completed.</p>

    <br />
    <p class="fw-bold">Is dual citizenship allowed under this program?</p>
    <p>The U.S. allows dual citizenship, but your original country of origin may not allow it.</p>
    <br />
    <p class="fw-bold">Can I apply if I am currently Out-Of-Status (i.e. you live in the United States but do not have a current visa)?</p>
    <p>Out-Of-Status nationals are no longer permitted to apply for permanent residency from within the United States.</p>

    question:
      "Must An Investor Have Real Estate Or Business Experience Or A Minimum Education Level To Participate?",
    answer: `<div>
    <p>There are no requirements with respects to experience or education.</p>

    <br />
    <p class="fw-bold">Can I apply if I’m been rejected or terminated in the past by USCIS for an L-1, E-2, B, or other visa?</p>
    <p>Rejection in the past does not disqualify the applicant, unless the reasons are related to immigration fraud or other significant problems.</p>
    <br />
    <p class="fw-bold">Why doesn’t any EB-5 offering guarantee a return of capital?</p>
    <p>A central requirement of the program is that an EB-5 investor’s capital must remain “at risk” for the duration of the conditional residency period.</p>
     <br />
    <p class="fw-bold">What issues have been the most problematic in EB-5 cases?</p>
    <p>In an era when the federal government more closely scrutinizes foreign direct investment, USCIS case examiners require a well-documented source of funds.</p>
     <br />
    <p class="fw-bold">What is a re-entry permit?</p>
    <p>To maintain your green card, you have to keep from abandoning your residence in the U.S. You can travel out of the U.S. no more than 180 days without abandoning your residence. You can apply for a re-entry permit, which allows you to stay out of the U.S. for up to two years without abandoning your residence.</p>
    <p>You can apply for a reentry permit (on form 1131) before you leave the U.S. You can depart before the reentry permit is approved. With such a reentry permit, you can also return to the US at any point until the reentry permit’s expiration date. Reentry permits are issued for two years. At the expiry of these two years, you can apply for a new one. The second such reentry permit will be granted for two years ago, but then onwards all subsequent ones may only be approved for one year at a time.</p>
    <p>If outside of the United States for two or more years after being issued a reentry permit, a Returning Resident (SB-1) immigrant visa is necessary. While outside the United States, permanent residents are still required to file U.S. income tax returns, and failure to do so may jeopardize their status. Permanent resident status will be considered abandoned if a green card holder moves to another country and no longer intends to reside in the United States.</p>
 <br />
     <p class="fw-bold">Can my green card be taken away from me?</p>
    <p>Once you receive your green card, there are only two conditions required to keep it for life.</p>
    <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
      <li class="list-group-item">You must not become removable or inadmissible. The most common way to do this is to be convicted of a serious crime.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">You do not abandon the United States as your permanent residence.</li>
     </ol>

      <br />
      <p class="fw-bold">How long does a green card last?</p>

      <p>By receiving your green card though an EB-5 investment, you should have a conditional green card for two years. You must apply for removal of the condition within 90 days before the two years are up. Once that is approved, you have a regular unconditional green card, which must be renewed after ten years.</p>


          <br />
      <p class="fw-bold">What happens to the family’s applications for green cards if the investor dies before or after granting the green cards – provisional and final?</p>

      <p>The second parent may take over as the principal applicant and the application continues. However, if you wish to not proceed with the application, the second parent may refuse to step in as principal applicant, in which case the application itself will be denied by USCIS.</p>


          <br />
      <p class="fw-bold">After my I-526 petition approval, may members of my family have their consular interview in different countries?</p>

      <p>Family members may interview in different countries. The country of origin or where the family has current ties is the standard interview site. However, a student attending school in the U.S. would not have to return to the country of origin; status can be adjusted in the United States at the district office of the USCIS</p>

</div>`,

  {
    id: 13,
    question: "What Is The Purpose Of The Consular Application And Interview?",
    answer: `<div>
    <p>The purpose of the Consular application is to ensure that the investor and family members undergo medical, police, security and immigration history checks before the conditional permanent resident visas are issued. At the interview, the Consular Officer may address these issues and information printed on the I-526 petition, including the nature of the investment. If the investor and family are in the United States, they may apply to adjust their status at the appropriate office of the USCIS.</p>

    <br />
    <p class="fw-bold">What are reasons the 1-829 petition may fail?</p>
    <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
      <li class="list-group-item">If the project does not create the jobs required.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Failure to maintain residency in the U.S.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Requirement of maintaining green card during conditional green card period.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">The investor must spend no more than 180 days outside of the U.S.</li>
     </ol>

      <br />
          <p class="fw-bold">After getting a green card, can an investor withdraw from an investment that created 10 jobs?</p>


      <p>Once the permit green card (1-829) petition is adjudicated, investment capital may be returned.</p>


          <br />
      <p class="fw-bold">What is a Reg D Investor vs. a Reg S Investor?</p>

      <p>Any investor who conducts the entire investment transaction (from induction to execution of documents) outside of the U.S. at the time of the application may be considered Reg S Investor. Any investor inside the U.S for any part of the transaction must be a Reg D Investor pursuant to U.S. securities laws. A Reg D investor must be an accredited investor.</p>


          <br />
      <p class="fw-bold">When will I be able to move to the United States?</p>

      <p>An EB-5 investor is eligible to enter the United States to begin a period of conditional permanent residency once their I-526E is approved, a visa becomes available (if the investor is from a country affected by visa retrogression) and they go through a consular interview process or adjustment of status if already located in the U.S. on another type of non-immigrant visa.</p>

</div>`,
  },

  {
    id: 14,
    question: `What is the difference between "conditional" and "permanent" green cards?`,
    answer: `<div>
    <p>The USCIS issues conditional green cards after approval of the 1526E petition. These green cards
last for two years. Investors receive permanent green cards upon USCIS approval of the 1-829
petition.</p>

    <br />
    <p class="fw-bold">What are the advantages of an EB-5 visa for prospective students?</p>
    <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
      <li class="list-group-item"> Brings certainty to the admissions process. You do not have to wait for a student visa and take the risk of consulate closure or visa denial.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Lower tuition (in-state/out-of-state tuition vs. international tuition rates).</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Opportunities to win scholarships or grants.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Available federal loans.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Freedom to choose educational courses. Not every course may qualify under the student visa program.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Broad internship opportunities.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Work while studying.</li>
     </ol>

      <br />
          <p class="fw-bold">What is Visa Retrogression?</p>


      <p>Under existing EB-5 rules, approximately 10,000 visas are allocated to the program each year. If all the 10,000 visas are used, each country is capped at a maximum of 7% of the total. As a result, countries with a large number of applicants may see a longer wait time to begin their period of conditional permanent residency. (USCIS posts quarterly updates on this topic)</p>


          <br />
      <p class="fw-bold">When an unmarried child gets married, will he continue to hold the green card? Will a spouse of the child also be eligible for a green card?</p>

      <p>The unmarried child, if a part of the I-526 petition, will retain the green card. Souses of children (dependent applications) are not eligible to join the petition.</p>


          <br />
      <p class="fw-bold">After my I-526 petition approval, may members of my family have their consular interview in different countries?</p>

      <p>Family members may interview in different countries. The country of origin or where the family has current ties is the standard interview site. However, a student attending school in the U.S. would not have to return to the country of origin; status can be adjusted in the United States at the district office of the USCIS.</p>

           <br />
      <p class="fw-bold">Do I have to live in the same state where I make my investment?</p>

      <p>No, you do not have to live in the same state as your investment. You can live anywhere in the United States.</p>
